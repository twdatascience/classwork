# Data Analytics
This is the coding work I did for the Data Analytics course I took. The code includes the assigned class work as well as tweeks and side excersises I added. Some of the R markdown files include references to data provided and reading assigned for the class. This is a repository of the code only.

Week 2 there was not a coding assignment.

Week 4 was all Tableau visualizations.
